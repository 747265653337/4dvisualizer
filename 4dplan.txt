a class, called 4d_cube

has a method, which takes a reference to a vertex array, and an int which specifies the coordinate of the fourth dimension
this method places all the vertecies into the array

it has a method which returns the model matrix

it has the location of the cube, in the four dimensional space
(it has the rotation of the cube, along all four axes)

every rendered cube will need an instance of this class. There will be a vector with 4d_cubes. 
During initiation, the model matrices get stored in an array. If the 4th coordinate of the camera changes, vertices will be refreshed.
